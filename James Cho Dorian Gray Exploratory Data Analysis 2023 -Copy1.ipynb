    "Hello Dr. Kraus, \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you read my exploratory data analysis below this note, I just wanted to quickly explain how I've worked in my dispersion plots and concordances: \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout my essay, I've made both very specific references to word offsets (ex. the 0-3800th word offset range or the 4000th word offset point), and indicated which dispersion plot or concordance those references are from (ex. the \"picture\", \"portrait\", and \"Sibyl\" dispersion plots). I did this in an attempt to make (in my opinion) this notebook and my analysis a much smoother read compared to if I'd chosen to copy/paste screenshots of these data visualisation functions every single time I mention them. I apologise if it's a little annoying to scroll back up and down between my analysis and my data because of this choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, please let me know if this notebook is non-functional for whatever reason (although I've tested it and it should work). You should hopefully not need to run anything if the notebook's saved my visualisation, but if you do need to run my notebook to see my dispersion plots and concordances, I've also uploaded the Mervyn.txt file alongside this assignment. If you do need to run the entire notebook, please do run all of it, even though you will see some parts of the original notebook that has a \"yellow_wallpaper\" variable in it, as it is part of the notebook and is NOT an error/holdover from the original notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outside of that, I also did write 1,514 words for this analysis. I know that that is very much past the word count limit and I apologise for that and will accept any points you doc for not being able to comply with the 900-1000 word limit for this assignment, but I believe that my analysis would be incomplete without it being this way. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, I hope that your surgery went well today and have a wonderful Thanksgiving break if you celebrate it!\n",

    "In The Picture of Dorian Gray, the main character Dorian struggles between the morals imposed by his two friends Basil and Lord Henry. Together, the ideologies and characters of Basil and Lord Henry act similar to the shoulder angel and devil plot devices that guide Dorian’s morality as he navigates through his Faustian deal with the portrait Basil painted of him. Simultaneously, Dorian’s strenuous relationship with Sibyl Vayne leads to Lord Henry’s ideology “winning” over Basil’s when Dorian kills Sybil, forever damning him as the experience causes him to become over-obsessed with maintaining his portrait’s physical beauty by any means necessary. A win which is only further solidified when Dorian rejects Basil and asks him to never come back. Through the use of dispersion plots and concordances on The Picture of Dorian Gray, it becomes possible to map out Dorian’s fall and the battle between Lord Henry and Basil’s moralities. Specifically, by observing how many times characters like Lord Henry, Basil, and Sibyl Vane are characterised by Dorian in parallel with his focus on his portrait and London in concordances and dispersion plots that are drawn from the novel. \n",
    "\n",
    "To begin, the dichotomy between Basil’s purity and Lord Henry’s immorality that are set to influence Dorian is presented to us within the first scenes. In the first chapter, for example, Basil explains that Dorian “has a simple and a beautiful nature.” (Wilde 18) He further begs Henry to not “spoil [Dorian]” or “try to influence him.” (Wilde 18) As readers, know, Lord Henry ignores these pleas and in “his low, musical voice” charms Dorian (Wilde 21). So much in just this first instance of them meeting Lord Henry subversively influences Dorian into making his Faustian wish that “the picture could change” so that he “could always be what [he] is now” in terms of age (Wilde 28). What’s important to note here about Basil and Lord Henry is not just the juxtaposition of their influences on Dorian, but almost how much they talk. As Basil himself says, he “never talk[s] when [he] is working, and never listen either” (Wilde 20). Again, Lord Henry is his opposite and will speak for paragraphs on end unless stopped. With these two major differences in the characters now established, we can see how Basil and Lord Henry’s influences battle against each other in our data. \n",
    "\n",
    "When looking at the dispersion plots and concordances of The Picture of Dorian Gray, it becomes clear that they reinforce my literary analysis of Basil and Lord Henry. Notably, per Basil’s more reserved nature, the dispersion plot for “Basil” is much more episodic and shorter than Lord Henry’s. Henry unlike Basil is mentioned much more consistently throughout the book, which tracks given the fact that Dorian becomes nearly infatuated with Lord Henry and his family such as Aunt Agatha and Lady Gwendolyn. This fact is also supported via concordances that I ran for the two of them, where I found a trend when running a concordance for the word “Henry” and “Basil”. Their concordances reveal that Basil is mentioned in 154 lines while Henry is mentioned nearly one hundred times more at 234 lines. This speaks to my earlier point about Lord Henry’s influence dominating the narrative, on top of the fact that unlike Basil’s concordances that don’t follow any particular pattern, Lord Henry’s concordance reveals that nearly every single time he is mentioned he spouts off some sort of wisdom to Dorian. Words such as “said”, “asked”, “cried”, “answered” and “murmured” practically precede every mention of Lord Henry’s name, and nearly every succeeding notation after his name in the concordance is a quotation mark denoting him continuing to talk. This in itself proves my points that Lord Henry ‘wins’ over Basil as both the dispersion plots and concordances support the fact that Lord Henry turns Dorian completely spoils Dorian, much to Basil’s chagrin. It should also be noted that although Henry already ‘won’ Dorian over into immorality, the dispersion plots for Henry and Basil reinforce my claim. Specifically, at around 8,000 words in, nearly all mention of Basil by Dorian stops, while Henry’s explodes. This is because in chapters 13 and 14, Dorian, now a completely twisted man, kills Basil to stop him from revealing Dorian’s portrait to the world. Dorian then blackmails his friend Alan Campbell into destroying Basil’s corpse with his knowledge of chemistry by threatening to expose Campbell’s homosexuality to all of London. In this manner, Dorian, under Lord Henry’s indirect influence, has both literally and figuratively killed off Basil entirely, embracing Lord Henry’s mentorship entirely. \n",
    "\n",
    "But what caused this enormous shift in Dorian’s character that pushed him over the edge such that he embraced Lord Henry’s philosophies? What made Dorian so obsessed with his portrait past his breaking point? The death of Sibyl Vane. When looking at my dispersion plots for “Sibyl”, “picture”, and “portrait” below, it becomes clear that this is true. For example, early in the novel we can see that Dorian barely ever mentions his portrait/picture (words 0 - 3800). This is because Dorian is both relatively innocent and enamoured by Sibyl, who according to her own dispersion plot is brought up a lot during this same word offset range. In chapter 4, Dorian expresses how he loves her “shy” and “gentle” nature when he met her, which coincidentally is how she falls in love with him when he talks to her after the play (Wilde 49). Dorian even goes so far as to declare that “Sibyl Vane is sacred!” (Wilde 48) \n",
    "\n",
    "However, two things happen that result in her death, which results in Dorian spiralling into Lord Henry’s immoral philosophies and atrocities. First, Lord Henry’s view of women in this same chapter as “a decorative sex”, a representation of “the triumph of matter over mind” to talk down Dorian’s infatuation with her. Second, due to her newfound love of Dorian, Sibyl is unable to feign love for the actor playing Romeo in chapter 7 when Dorian takes Basil and Henry to see her perform. This results in all three acknowledging her beauty but also results in Dorian seeing her as “absolutely incompetent” and embarrassing for him after talking her up to his two friends (Wilde 73). Sibyl Vane effectively loses her “portrait” (i.e. her talent for acting) that had hid her true self behind the beauty of her youth, much like how Dorian’s painting hid his sins. Dorian fell into the same trap that Basil had fallen into with Dorian’s youth, and once that youthful innocence of hers was lost Dorian saw Sibyl only through the lens about women that Lord Henry had taught him. Yet, per my dispersion plots for Sibyl, as well as the words “picture” and “portrait”, we’re able to see that as much as Dorian denies his love for Sibyl he still very clearly did. Because despite Lord Henry’s influence, when Dorian learns of her death at about the 4000th word offset, we see an incredible rise in frequency in the number of times Dorian mentions (and therefore looks) at his portrait in the dispersion plots. Through both the “portrait” and “picture” dispersion plots around the 4000th word offset, I can definitely assert that after Sibyl commits suicide Dorian begins his crime spree in the East end of London, again meaning that Lord Henry’s philosophy ‘wins’ over Basil’s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through the use of dispersion plots and concordances, I have mapped out key events that led to Dorian’s fall and the battle between Lord Henry and Basil’s moralities. In doing so, I’ve augmented my close reading of The Picture of Dorian Gray and its primary characters, especially Lord Henry, Basil, and Sibyl’s importance to Dorian’s demise. Although Oscar Wilde today is now celebrated, I hope that my use of a data analysis mixed with my literary analysis disproves his era’s critics about this novel being nonsensically perverse and immoral. That instead, this story reflects the ugly truth about the Lord Henrys that existed in Wilde’s time. Before I close this analysis, I would like to say that this close reading of mine solely focused on events and characters that the Exploratory Data Analysis notebook’s functions found important. If I had both more time and more ways of exploring the literary data of Dorian Gray, my goal would be to do an even closer reading about less central events in the story and how they further contributed to the events and characters I’ve discussed here. For example, events like Dorian’s many visits to the East End of London’s drug houses, brothels, or the pessimism Dorian is exposed to relatively early on at Aunt Agatha’s ball from Lord Henry’s family. In addition, a limitation that I found with the notebook is the inability to assess Oscar Wilde’s clear criticism of England’s homophobia during the Victorian era, which I only mentioned briefly in the form of poor Campbell in this data analysis. With these steps to move forward to, I hope that at some point in the future, either in this class or after it, I’ll be able to look through this phenomenal book again. "

First let's open and read our file. This code should look very familiar to you by now. I'm using \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" as my example, but you can substitute your own text file to work with a different novel. Just be sure it's in UTF-8 format! I'll assign \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" to the variable \"yellow_wallpaper\" (you can use whatever variable you want, as long as you're consistent! Alternatively, feel free to retain my variables when analyzing your own text just to avoid errors):"
